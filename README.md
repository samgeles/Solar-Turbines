**Important Note**

- original datasets cannot be shared due to NDA (only workproducts such as viz and insights)
- specific data points are anonymized by our stakeholder for security purposes 

**Project Summary**

Solar Turbines Global Supply Chain Operations Analytics Project (Jan 2024 - Current)

- My role in this project was to conduct analysis for 3 scenarios
  1) General Cost Overview For All Domestic and Foreign Shipments
  2) Cost Per Mile Analysis (Domestic Shipments)
  3) Cost Per Pound Analysis (International Shipments) 

- Our team's overall objective is to collaborate with Solar Turbines' SCM team to analyze global shipping data, identify accessorial charge trends, and optimize shipping mode mixes, resulting in shipping charge reductions.
  
- The objectives pertaining to my specifc role include:
  1) identifying data quality issues, data cleaning, data transforming 
  2) extract and present unique cost trends and patterns with the data given to us
  3) develop robust dashboarding tools that can be handed off to Solar Turbines so that they can conduct futher analysis. 

  ________________________
  **Challenges**
  - anonymized data makes it hard for us to conduct any product analysis
  - only given data for past 3 years
  - data inconsistency and incompleteness; data required heavy cleaning
  - extremely large datasets increased script execution time
 
  **Technology Used**
  - Python
  - Tableau
  - Excel

  **Techniques Used**
  - intial exploratory data analysis using python to identify data quality issues and outliers
  - transformed values and created new variables using python and excel
  - analyzed data trends and visualized data using Tableau
  - created calculated fields on-the-fly in Tableau to observe how new variables react

  **Results**

Overall average accessorial charges have been increasing year over year. When looking at in-year accessorial charge trends we can actually observe a trend reversal. Years 2020 and 2021 have exhibited downward trends for accessorial charges, but now years 2022 and 2023 have been exhibiting increasing avg accessorial charge trends.

When looking at the relationship between costs and carriers used weâ€™ve identified that carrier Davis-Robinson has highest total amount paid for shipments, carrier Jones-Jones has highest avg amount paid for shipments, and carrier Taylor Ltd has highest count of shipments.
