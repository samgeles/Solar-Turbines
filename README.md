**Project Summary**

Solar Turbines Global Supply Chain Operations Analytics Project (Jan 2024 - Current)

- My role in this project was to conduct analysis for 3 scenarios
  1) General Cost Overview For All Domestic and Foreign Shipments
  2) Cost Per Mile Analysis (Domestic Shipments)
  3) Cost Per Pound Analysis (International Shipments) 

- Our team's overall objective is to collaborate with Solar Turbines' SCM team to analyze global shipping data, identify accessorial charge trends, and optimize shipping mode mixes, resulting in shipping charge reductions.
  
- The objectives pertaining to my specifc role include:
  1) identifying data quality issues, data cleaning, data transforming 
  2) extract and present unique cost trends and patterns with the data given to us
  3) develop robust dashboarding tools that can be handed off to Solar Turbines so that they can conduct futher analysis.

  - anonymized data makes it hard for us to conduct any product analysis
  - only given data for past 3 years
  - data inconsistency and incompleteness; data required heavy cleaning
  - extremely large datasets increased script execution time
 
  **Technology Used**
  - Python
  - Tableau
  - Excel

  **Techniques Used**
  - intial exploratory data analysis using python to identify data quality issues and outliers
